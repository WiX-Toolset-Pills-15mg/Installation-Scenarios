# Installation Scenarios

## Description

Windows Installer is providing a set of properties based on which we can deduce what scenario is running (install, uninstall, repair, etc).

But it is not very intuitively what properties should be checked for each scenario. We propose a set of custom properties to create in our installers that can helps us in this direction.

This tutorial demonstrates how to identify the different types of installation scenarios (install, uninstall, repair, etc.)
