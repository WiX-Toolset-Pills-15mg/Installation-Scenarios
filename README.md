# Boxing and Unboxing

## Pill Category

Language (C#)

## Description

**Boxing**

- When an instance of a value type is cast to a reference type, a "coat" is created over the instance, in order to be perceived as a reference type. This is called boxing.

**Unboxing**

- Unboxing is the reversed process, of extracting the value from the "coat".

**Question**

Everybody knows that boxing and unboxing are very time consuming. But, is it really true? This C# Pill is trying to answer this question:

- Are the boxing and unboxing processes really as time consuming as it is said?
